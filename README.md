# Customer Churn Prediction using ANN 
# 📊 Customer Churn Prediction using ANN

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting **customer churn** using an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)**.  
Customer churn refers to whether a customer is likely to **leave or stay with a company**.

The model is trained on a churn dataset and is capable of making predictions on new customer data.  
An interactive **Streamlit web application** is used to visualize inputs and display predictions in real time.
